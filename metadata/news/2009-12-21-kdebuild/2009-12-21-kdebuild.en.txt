kdebuild-1 was an EAPI used by the Gentoo KDE team and the Genkdesvn
project for various live ebuilds in overlays.

The Gentoo Council has decided that all mention of the kdebuild-1 EAPI
is to be removed from the Package Manager Specification immediately. As
such, support for this EAPI, including support for uninstalling
packages with that EAPI, will be removed from Paludis in version 0.44.

Users should verify that they have no kdebuild-1 packages installed. If
Paludis was built with the 'inquisitio' use flag enabled, you can use:

    $ inquisitio -K installed -k EAPI kdebuild-1

Otherwise, use:

    $ paludis -q '*/*::/[.EAPI=kdebuild-1]'

and, if any such packages are installed, they must be uninstalled
before Paludis is upgraded.
